I. Explanations to the Csata_et_al_2022_among_colony_interactions.csv file

- ColCode2 – colony identifier of the live individual, that is: the colony where it comes from
- IndCode – unique identification tag of the live individual
- ColCode 1 – colony identifier of the corpse/dummy, that is: the colony where it comes from
- IndCode – unique identification tag of the corpse/dummy
- Infection – presence/absence of fungal infection in individuals – I – infected, U – uninfected
- Test – experimental test type as described in the attached preprint: (a) extract = extracted cuticular hydrocarbon was added to the mentioned party; (b) untreated = the mentioned party was untreated; (c) +C23 = only C23 was added; (d) Extract+C23 = extracted cuticular hydrocarbon and C23 was added to the mentioned party; (e) washed = the mentioned party was previously washed with hexane.
- Dummy – the treatment received by the dummy as described above in the ‘Test’ section.
- No. of interactions (count data) for each different type in accordance with the attached preprint manuscript: Carrying (the dummy is carried by the live ant), Anten (Antennating – the live ant taps with its antennae the corpse/dummy), Mand_gap (Mandible gapping – the live ants opens its mandibles threateningly), Biting (the live ant bites on the corpse/dummy), Dragging (the live ant bites on the corpse/dummy and drags it), Autogr (Autogrooming), Groom (Allogrooming), Total, Adverse (total no. of adverse interactions).
